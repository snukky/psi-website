Twelve participating systems and the unchanged input of the CoNLL-2014 shared task have been reassessed in a WMT-inspired human evaluation procedure. Methods introduced for the Workshop of Machine Translation evaluation campaigns have been adapted to GEC and extended where necessary. 
The produced rankings are used to evaluate standard metrics for grammatical error correction in terms of correlation with human judgment.}

  daily conversations and travel-related conversations between two agents, for the English-German language pair (both directions) are examined.   
  The  SMT  component  is  built  from  out-of-domain  but freely-available bilingual and monolingual data.  We make use of  most  of  the  known  
  available  resources  to  examine  the  effects of unrestricted data and large scale models. A naive baseline  delivers  solid  results  in  terms 
  of  MT-quality.Extending the baseline with context-based translation model features like operations sequence models, higher-order class-based 
  language models, and additional web-scale word-based  language  models  leads  to  a  system  that  significantly  outperforms  the  baseline.   
  Domain  adaption  is  performed  by  separately  weighting the influence of the out-of-domain subcorpora. This is explored for 
  translation models and language models yielding significant improvements in both cases. Automatic and manual evaluation results are 
  provided for raw MT-quality and ASR+MT-quality.},

  The United Nations (UN) granted IMO the right to use UN resources and we describe experiments and results we obtained with different translation model combination techniques.
  While BLEU results remain inconclusive for combinations, we also analyze user preferences for certain models (when choosing between IMO only or combined with UN).

  Statistical machine translation toolkits like Moses have not been 
designed with grammatical error correction in mind. In order to achieve 
competitive results in this area, it is not enough to simply add more data. 
Optimization procedures need to be customized, task-specific features should be 
introduced. Only then can the decoder take advantage of relevant data.

We demonstrate the validity of the above claims by combining web-scale language 
models and large-scale error-corrected texts with parameter tuning according to 
the task metric and correction-specific features. Our system achieves a result 
of 35.0\% F0.5 on the blind CoNLL-2014 test set, ranking on third place. A 
similar system, equipped with 
identical models but without tuned parameters and specialized features, 
stagnates at 25.4\%.
